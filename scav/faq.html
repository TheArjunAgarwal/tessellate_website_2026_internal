    <h2>What is this event?</h2>
    <p>Who knows buddy? Please note that the website you are on has nothing to do with it and is just a construct created for no purpose.</p>
    <h2>When is this event?</h2>
    <p>
        I don't think the font is small there but, if you shall ask </p>
        <p>
        <span style="font-size: 40px;"><b>23 - 26 January</b></span>
    </p>
    <h2>How do I take part?</h2>
    <p>
        Finally a question worth answering. If you are a CMI student (or alumini or prof), you can make your own team or join a team who is looking for members. If you are not a CMI student, you should try to contact a friend within and join their team. If you don't know anyone, inform us and we will try to pair you up with a team.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the rules on the teams?</h2>
    <p>
        4 members or lesser. In a n member team, n-1 must be CMI affiliated. 
    </p>
    <h2>So I can take part solo?</h2>
    <p>
        In theory, yes. But get the f*&k out of your room and make friends. Why would anyone wanna take part alone? It is more fun as a team .
    </p>
    <h2>So I don't wanna take part, I am just a class 11/12 student who found this page. How to clear CMI?</h2>
    <p>
        No idea bro. Arjun and Vighnesh are not very smart. So instead of giving the examination, they went to Galapagos Islands. Then they swam straight till they reached the key point. After months of digging and passing straight through the Earth (using an AC on our back to cool ourselves), we reached CMI.
    </p>
    <p>
        The short and frank answer is, wrong page bro. Anyways, Arjun and Vighnesh are pretty open to mails and doubts etc.l
