<h2>The Hunt</h2> 
<p>All items on the list can, and absolutely should, be obtained or performed legally. The Judges take zero responsibility for your life choices if they land you in hot water, deep <s>shit</s> trouble or the doghouse. </p> <p> Also, a quick note on "creativity": being nude when it’s not asked for won’t get you extra points. Neither will involving alcohol, drugs or sex in items that don't specifically call for them. Finally, <strong>don't be a jerk to animals.</strong> If it can make sad eyes at us, treat it with extreme care.</p>

<h2>Fair Play</h2> 
<p>Sabotage is lame. We don’t like it, and it has no place in the Hunt. If we catch you sabotaging other teams or their hard-earned items, expect immediate disqualification. We might even let loose the hounds of the Administration on you, and nobody wants that.</p>

<h2>Contact with Judges</h2> 
<p>You can talk to us, but don’t expect us to just hand out the answers. 
If you’re going to slide into our DMs (or talk to us in person), please keep it civil.Generally, just remember that the more people shout, the less will be understood. That seems like a logical thing, right?</p>

<h2>Judgement Day</h2>
<p>Judgment Day starts on <strong>Sunday at 10:30 p.m.</strong> with the Showcase Items. Everything else follows right after. </p> <p> Much like the version in the Bible, Judgment Day <em>should</em> technically only take about 45 minutes. However, Scav is essentially Hell, so be prepared to wait. To make things go faster: </p> <ul> <li>Have a <strong>highlighted list</strong> of everything you’ve actually done.</li> <li>Don't waste time with "Wait, do we have the particle accelerator?" questions to your team when we do the counting.</li> <li>Arrange the things you have in a logical order</li> <li>In general, be organized.</li> </ul> <p> If you have something massive or stationary, you can use your <s>beg</s> request us to visit you elsewhere, but do that sparingly.
</p>
<h2>Events</h2> 
<p>
    In addition to Judgment Day, a variety of events are scheduled to take place over the period 
    of the Hunt. Times and locations will be stated at the list as well might be mentioned in the website.
</p>
<h2>Points</h2> 
<p>Point totals are final. We ask for awesome things, you do awesome things, and we give you <strong>Full Points</strong>. </p> <p> If you go absolutely nuclear—like if we ask for a car and you bring us the bat mobile, we <em>might</em> give you one or two special points. </p>
<p> As for how we value items? We use a sophisticated mix of a dice, punching each other and Tibetan numerology. Do not complain that the "lazy eye patch" was worth more than your "functional moonbounce made of guns."</p>
<h2>AI</h2> 
<p>Don’t use it.</p>
<h2>Digital Items</h2> 
<p> If an item has a floppy disk symbol (💾) next to it, it’s a digital item. Upload it to the Google Drive Folder by <strong>9:00 p.m. on Monday (the 26th)</strong>. </p> <blockquote> <strong>Crucial:</strong> Name your files exactly like this: "ITEM INDEX - TEAM NAME". If you don't, we're not hunting for it. </blockquote>
<h2>Decisions</h2> 
<p>All decisions of the Judges are final.</p>
