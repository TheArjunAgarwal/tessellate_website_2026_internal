        <p>
            We need to assign all the teams drives to upload stuff too as well as have a rough idea of participation size and all.

            While we may allow spot entry, it will cost you (points, we don't care about money).

    <h2>Welcome to the Chaos</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the first Scav Hunt at CMI. Four days. One list.
    </p>
    <p>
        The event is <s>shamelessly stolen</s> heavily inspired from U Chicago's Scav. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Hence to describe the event, we'll <s>further plagiarize</s> quote from their website:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        This is not your elementary school's scavenger hunt. The list contains items that must be found in the style of a traditional scavenger hunt, but there are many other items that must be built, performed, written, programmed, drawn, eaten, designed, painted, solved, won, and (maybe) endured. 
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Teams of 4 are allowed of which 3 have to be CMI affliated. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Prepare your teams. Read the rules carefully. and Get ready! <s>I’m A King But I’m Far From A Saint, They Call Me A Bad ... </s> (sorry, Dhurandhar fever)
    </p>
